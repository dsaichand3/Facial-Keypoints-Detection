# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview
### Results are not generated from the model that has been trained. Thus, results might not be same.

This is the first project from the course. In this project, 
computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures are used together to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points 
around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, 
and emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of 
these keypoints are displayed below.

#### This project has been further extended in Python & Tensorflow with C++ interface.
