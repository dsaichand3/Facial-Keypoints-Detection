# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

In this project, computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures are used together to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.

#### This project has been further extended in Python & Tensorflow with C++ interface.
